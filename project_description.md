## 6\. üß± Architecture

-   **Diagram:** `docs/architecture.png` (A diagram showing Next.js client, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL DB, and Redis cache as separate, containerized services).

### Modules

-   **API Service (FastAPI):** Handles all business logic, RESTful API endpoints, and database interactions. Implements role-based access control.
-   **Web Client (Next.js):** A Single Page Application (SPA) responsible for all UI rendering. Includes a public-facing site, a user settings area, and a protected admin panel. It will use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for initial page loads for performance and SEO, and client-side rendering for subsequent navigation.
-   **Database (PostgreSQL):** The primary data store for users, roles, articles, comments, etc.
-   **Cache (Redis):** Used for caching frequently accessed data, such as published articles and site-wide metrics, to reduce database load and improve response times.

### API Specification

-   **Specification File:** `docs/openapi.json`. The API will be self-documenting via FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI generation.

### Data Flow Example: Creating a New Post

1.  A logged-in user with the 'WRITER' role submits the new post content from the `Web Client` (Next.js).
2.  The `Web Client` sends a `POST` request with the article data (including `category_id` and an array of `tags`) and the user's JWT to the `API Service`'s `/api/v1/articles/` endpoint.
3.  The `API Service` (FastAPI) validates the JWT, authorizes the user by checking for the 'WRITER' role, and validates the incoming article data.
4.  The `API Service` saves the new article to the `PostgreSQL Database` and creates associations in the `article_tags` table.
5.  The `API Service` invalidates any relevant caches in `Redis`.
6.  The `API Service` returns a `201 Created` response with the newly created article data.
7.  The `Web Client` redirects the user to the newly created article page.

### State Management (Frontend)

-   **Strategy:** The `Web Client` will use **React Context** for global state management (e.g., user authentication status and an array of roles). For more complex state, a library like **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit** could be employed. Server-side data fetching and caching will be handled by Next.js's built-in capabilities and libraries like SWR or React Query.

## 12\. üîå Integrations

-   **Email Service:** (Optional for MVP)
-   **Image Storage:** (Optional for MVP)

---

## 13\. üîç Observability & Ops

### Logging

-   **Strategy:** Structured logging (JSON format) for both FastAPI and Next.js applications. Logs will be output to `stdout` to be managed by Docker.

### Metrics

-   **Strategy:** The FastAPI application will expose a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus to scrape. Key metrics will include request latency, error rates, and database performance.

### Tracing

-   **Strategy:** (Post-MVP) Implement distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry to trace requests across the Next.js and FastAPI services.

---

## 14\. üîÑ CI/CD

-   **Provider:** GitHub Actions
-   **Workflows:**
    -   **`ci.yml`:** On every push to `main` or a PR, this workflow will:
        1. Lint the code (Python & JS).
        2. Run unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
        3. Build Docker images.
    -   **`deploy.yml`:** On merge to `main`, this workflow will:
        1. Push Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
        2. Deploy the new versions to the production environment.

---

## 15\. üìö Documentation

-   **API Documentation:** Automatically generated and served by FastAPI at `/docs`.
-   **README.md:** Detailed instructions for setting up and running the project locally using Docker.
-   **Component Documentation:** (Optional) Storybook for the Next.js components.

---

## 16\. üîê Security

-   **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication. Access tokens will be short-lived, with a refresh token mechanism.
-   **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented in the FastAPI backend. API endpoints will be protected by dependencies that verify the user has the required role (e.g., 'WRITER', 'ADMIN') in their list of assigned roles.
-   **Password Security:** Passwords will be hashed using `bcrypt`.
-   **Input Validation:** Pydantic will be used in FastAPI for rigorous input validation to prevent injection attacks.
-   **CORS:** A strict Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy will be configured in FastAPI.
-   **HTTPS:** The application will be served over HTTPS in production.
-   **Dependency Scanning:** Use of tools like Dependabot or Snyk to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.

---

## 17\. üß≠ Governance

-   **Versioning Policy:** Semantic Versioning.
-   **Code Style:** `black` and `isort` for Python, `prettier` for JavaScript/TypeScript.
-   **Branching Strategy:** GitFlow (or a simplified version with `master` and feature branches).
-   **Commit Strategy:** Feature branches for new features, bugfixes, etc., should be squashed into a single, meaningful commit when merging into the `master` branch to maintain a clean and understandable git history.
-   **Testing Requirement:** All new features must be accompanied by corresponding unit tests to ensure code quality, verify functionality, and prevent regressions.

## 18\. ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

This project will require separate configurations for different environments to ensure security and proper behavior.

-   **Development:** Geared for local development with features like hot-reloading, debug mode enabled, and connection to local Docker services.
-   **Testing:** Uses a dedicated test database and may disable certain services to isolate tests.
-   **Production:** Optimized for performance and security. Debug mode is disabled, and it connects to production-level services and databases.

### Configuration Strategy

-   **Docker:** Separate `compose.yaml` files will be used for each environment (e.g., `compose.production.yaml` for production, `compose.override.yaml` for development). The development compose file will mount local code volumes for hot-reloading.
-   **Backend (FastAPI):** Configuration will be managed via environment variables, loaded using Pydantic's `BaseSettings`. `.env` will be used for shared settings, `.env.development` for development-specific settings, and `.env.production` for production settings.
-   **Frontend (Next.js):** Next.js has built-in support for environment variables. `.env` will be used for shared settings, `.env.development` for development-specific settings, and `.env.production` for production settings.

This approach ensures that sensitive information like production database credentials or API keys are not hardcoded or exposed in the development environment.

### Development Docker Services

The `compose.override.yaml` file is designed for an interactive and flexible development workflow. It allows developers to manage dependencies directly within the running containers, mimicking a local setup while maintaining containerization benefits.

-   **Backend (FastAPI & uv)** üêç

    -   **Purpose:** Runs the FastAPI application with hot-reloading.
    -   **Dependency Management:** The service mounts the `backend/` source code as a volume. To add or remove a Python package, a developer can open a shell in the running container (`docker-compose exec backend bash`). Inside the container, they can use **`uv`** to manage dependencies (e.g., `uv add <package>`). This provides a fast and interactive way to manage Python dependencies without rebuilding the image.

-   **Frontend (Next.js & pnpm)** ‚öõÔ∏è

    -   **Purpose:** Runs the Next.js development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
    -   **Dependency Management:** The service mounts the `frontend/` source code as a volume. Similar to the backend, a developer can get a shell in the container (`docker-compose exec frontend bash`) and use `pnpm` to add/remove dependencies (e.g., `pnpm add <package>`). Changes are immediately reflected in the `package.json` and lock files on the host machine.

-   **E2E Testing (Playwright)** üé≠
    -   **Purpose:** Provides an on-demand environment for running end-to-end tests.
    -   **Configuration:** This service uses the official Microsoft Playwright image, which comes with all necessary browser binaries and dependencies pre-installed. It mounts the frontend code so it can access the test files.
    *   **Workflow:** This service does not run continuously. It is started on-demand by the developer to execute the test suite against the running frontend and backend services using a command like `docker-compose run --rm playwright npx playwright test`.
